## Resume
This application pretends to be a Pokedex in which you can see all some data of all the pokemons.
Soon I will implement the search bar to add another layer of functionality to the application.

## Notes
Please don't use the browser buttons because it may cause a problem with redux-toolkit, I'll be working to fix that.

## Available Scripts

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `yarn preview`

you can see how your application will look like once it is deployed to a domain
